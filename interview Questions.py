# q2) data types in python
# ->there are many datatypes in pyhon i start with fundamental dattypes
# 1)int,float,complex,boolean,string and 
# complex datatypes those are
# byte,bytearray,list,tuple,dicitonary,set,frozenset

# q3) which are identity operators and explain them.
# -> is and is not
# is operator is use to compare address of object if address is same returns True
# is not operator is use to compare address if is diffrent it returns true

# q4) what is conditonal opreator 
# ->first we check condition if its true then the block of Code executes
#if, if else, elif ladder

# q5) expalin logical oprator
# -> And, Or ,not
# in And and or their are two expression left and right
# in and operator if both the expressions are true it return true if anyone is false it returns false
# in or operator if anyone of the expression is ture it returns true ,it return false if both are false
# in not it reverse the expession if expression is true->false false->true

# q6) How to take data from User
# -> by using  input() function is a function which get data from the User
# input function whatever data we take it takes into string datatype,
# if you want to take another datatype you need to convert it,
# for ex if you want to take integer from the user form input function u need to typecast with int function

# otherwise we have eval function which will evaluate according to datatype provided
# ex;> eval(input("Enter data"))
# if list give in [] brackets it takes list datatype

# q7)What is swapcase() function in python.
# -> it is a string builtin function which converts uppercase to lowercase
# lowercase to upperase

# q8) what is diffrence between / and //
# -> / (divison operator )use for divisionl -> after dividing it returns float value if we not want flaot we use
#    // (floor divison) use for floor division ->returns int

# q9)What does python is dynamically typed langauge means
# -> you dont have to declare datatpe intially in Python
#   whatever data you give the varaible forms that datatype that why python is dynamically type
# 
# q10)what is difference between mutable and immutable datatype
# -> immutable once object is created you cannot make changes ex. tuple,int, float, string
# mutable the once the object is created you can make changes ex. list,set dictionary

# q11) Built-in methods of set
# --> some built-in methods of set are add() update()
# union() intersection() intersection_update()
# symettricdifference() symettrcdiffrenece_update
# difference() remove() discard() clear() pop()
